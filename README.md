QuartzAdmin v1.0
====================================

Updated the existing code, from https://code.google.com/p/quartznet-admin/, to use the latest libraries and nuget! 

Whatever the community wants to add to this project I'll incorporate, through pull requests and issues(enhancement)[https://github.com/japerr/QuartzAdmin/issues/new].

Currently it is configured to use postgres out of the box. I took some time to ensure it compiles out to the box and works with little trouble. So if you have any issues please create a ticket here: https://github.com/japerr/QuartzAdmin/issues/new, be specific and any reproduction steps are always of great help.

A postgres installation is required, the SQL is located in the database folder a the top level. First run sample.scheduler.console then run QuartzAdmin.web
